#TreeGravity Info
  #CONFIG VARIABLE INFORMATION
    #GENERAL VARIABLES (apply to all tgTypes; 1,2,3,4)
      #tgType
        #desc: Determines which method is enabled, lumberjack [1,2,3] or gravity [4]
        #
        #values: [1, 2, 3, or 4]
        #  1 = Lumberjack Classic; You break one log on a tree and the entire tree falls down.
        #      The number of logs the tree has are dropped in a stack at location of the block you broke.
        #      A sapling is dropped for every 20 logs the tree has.
        #  2 = Lumberjack Natural; You break one log on a tree and the entire tree falls down.
        #      Each log on the tree breaks naturally, so the logs will not drop in a uniform fashion
        #      like they do with LumberJack Classic/Random
        #  3 = Lumberjack Random; Same logic as LJ Classic, but the number of logs dropped will be
        #      anywhere from 20% more or less logs the tree actually had.
        #      So if a tree had 10 logs, anywhere from 8 to 12 will actually be dropped for the player.
        #  4 = Gravity (experimental); You break a log of a tree and any logs directly above will fall
        #      down one block like sand/gravel. Does not work with mushroom trees.
        #      ## Warning: This method cannot distinguish between logs on a tree and logs placed by a player.
        #                   See Update 3.0.0 for a temporary solution (hopefully I'll find a solution eventually)
        #
      #toolsAllowed
        #desc: Tools that allow the aforementioned methods to work on trees, when that tool is used
        #      to chop a tree. Only add tools in order to avoid any errors.
        #      You can only add axes with the '/tgconfig tools add' command, but can add any other tools directly here in the config.
        #
        #values: [WOODEN_AXE, STONE_AXE, IRON_AXE, GOLDEN_AXE, DIAMOND_AXE], but other tools can be added directly here in the config.
        #
      #chopMethod
        #desc: Adds the ability to require players to sneak/crouch before TreeGravity methods will work.
        #
        #values: [default, sneak, or sneak.notify]
        #  default = The player does not need to explicitly crouch to get TreeGravity methods to work.
        #            TreeGravity methods will work whether the player is standing or crouching.
        #  sneak = The player needs to crouch to get TreeGravity methods to work. There WONT BE notifications
        #          telling the player TreeGravity modes are active when they crouch with an axe.
        #  sneak.notify = The player needs to crouch to get TreeGravity methods to work. There WILL BE notifications
        #          telling the player TreeGravity modes are active when they crouch with an axe.
        #
      #updateChecker
        #desc: Checks whether your version of TreeGravity is the most recent version available.  
        #      If true, the following link is accessed: https://textuploader.com/d7v57/raw
        #
        #values: [true or false]
        #
      #debugger
        #desc: When set to true, when you chop down a tree the following will be printed in your server's console: 
        #        -the tree's log type, location, the number of logs the tree has, and your axe's durability.
        #      Only shows your axe durability when the Gravity method is enabled
        #
        #values: [true or false]
        #
    #LUMBERJACK VARIABLES (apply for only lumberjack tgTypes; 1,2,3)
      #houseProtection
        #desc: Determines how strict the plugin is when determining whether a structure is manmade or a tree, by
        #      looking at how many of the tree's logs share the same Y value location. If there are too many logs
        #      sharing the same Y value, the structure is labeled 'manmade', and does not get chopped down.
        #
        #      Tip: Many dark oak trees spawn in connected to one another, so you may need to disjoint them first before
        #      being able to fell the trees.
        #
        #      See Update 3.7.0 for more details: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-13-treegravity.59283/update?update=249831
        #
        #values: [0, 1, 2, or 3]
        #  0 = House protection is disabled. The plugin will act without this increased manmade structure protection,
        #      but will still be generally good at distinguishing houses from trees.
        #      ## If you use 0, be weary of building houses out of many logs, and using leaves as decoration
        #      placed directly on the house, as the plugin may think your house is a tree.
        #  1 = Low House Protection. Can still fell/chop down most trees without any issues, but may fell a
        #      small house with leaves attached to it.
        #  2 = Moderate House Protection. Not as stringent as level 3, but not as lax as level 1.
        #      Is it juuuust right? That's for you to decide.
        #  3 = Conservative House Protection. The plugin becomes extremely conservative/strict when deciding that
        #      a structure is a tree. On level 3, trees with a "bottom base" of 4 logs will not fell (the "bottom base" 
        #      being the logs touching the dirt/grass with the lowest Y value). This applies to jungle and dark oak trees, and you 
        #      will need to chop one of the base logs so that there are only 3 on the ground in order to get them to fell.
        #        
      #fairDurability
        #desc: Toggles whether your axe durability declines by the amount of logs that are harvested from the tree chopped
        #      down with Lumberjack methods.
        #
        #values: [true or false]
        #
      #durabilityMultiplier
        #desc: The degree of durability damage each log has on your axe/tool. The default config value (1.0) is the vanilla value.
        #      Changing the value up or down indirectly affects tool life. For example, the life of an iron axe at the following 
        #      values will be: 0.5 = 500 logs; 1.0 = 250 logs; 2.0 = 125 logs; etc.
        #      ## I DO NOT SUGGEST SETTING THIS MULTIPLIER ABOVE 2 OR 3, as durability is pretty well balanced in vanilla minecraft anyways
        #
        #values: [0.5, 1, or 2], but any positive decimal number will work (a negative number will repair your axe)
        #      With '/tgconfig set durabilitymultiplier' you can set the value within [0 < x < 25].
        #      You cannot set it higher to 25 or lower than 0 with the command. You can change it to anything you want directly here in the config,
        #      but is not recommended for survival gameplay. I cannot even recommend setting this value higher than 3.0 in a survival server.
        #
      #autoReplant
        #desc: Toggles whether saplings are replanted automatically once you chop down a tree. If so,
        #      there is about a 3 second delay before saplings are replanted. Due to the current logic,
        #      if you chop down a jungle tree from high up, the saplings will replant and then be broken.
        #
        #values: [true or false]
        #
      #saplingDrop
        #desc: Drops a stack of saplings immediately with the tree's logs at the base of a tree. 
        #      This setting only applies to the Lumberjack Classic and Random methods. 
        #      The sapling stack will have 1 sapling for every tree, plus an additional sapling for
        #      every ~18 logs the tree has.
        #
        #values: [true or false]
